## Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code with accurate Spring Boot examples.
- Use Spring Boot best practices and conventions throughout your code.
- Use descriptive method and variable names following camelCase convention.
- Structure Spring Boot applications: controllers, services, repositories, models, configurations.
- 
## Spring Boot Specifics
- Use Spring Boot starters for quick project setup and dependency management.
- Implement proper use of annotations (e.g., @SpringBootApplication, @RestController, @Service).
- Utilize Spring Boot's auto-configuration features effectively.
- Implement proper exception handling using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.

## Configuration and Properties
- Use application.properties for configuration.
- Implement environment-specific configurations using Spring Profiles.
- Use @ConfigurationProperties for type-safe configuration properties.

## Java and Spring Boot Usage
- Use top notch Java version features when applicable (e.g., records, sealed classes, pattern matching).
- Leverage Spring Boot 3.x features and best practices.
- Use Spring Data JPA for database operations when applicable.
- Implement proper validation using Bean Validation (e.g., @Valid, custom validators).



## Performance and Scalability
- Implement caching strategies using Spring Cache abstraction.
- Use async processing with @Async for non-blocking operations.
- Implement proper database indexing and query optimization.

## Security
- Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Use proper password encoding (e.g., BCrypt).
- Implement CORS configuration when necessary.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Use SLF4J with Logback for logging.
- Implement proper log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG).
- Use Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring and metrics.

## Data Access and ORM
- Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.
- Implement proper entity relationships and cascading.
- Use database migrations with tools like Flyway or Liquibase.

## Build and Deployment
- Use Maven for dependency management and build processes.
- Implement proper profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod).
- Use Docker for containerization if applicable.

## Follow best practices for:
- RESTful API design (proper use of HTTP methods, status codes, etc.).
- Micro services architecture (if applicable).
- Asynchronous processing using Spring's @Async or reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.

Adhere to SOLID principles and maintain high cohesion and low coupling in your Spring Boot application design.
