**Architectural Design for Oman App Microservices**

As an experienced software architect, I will outline the microservices architecture for the Oman App, define the projects and repositories needed, and explain how they will be bundled for both local development and cloud deployment on AWS using Kubernetes, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

---

### **1. Micro services Breakdown**

Based on the modules described, each module will be split into two microservices: one for the backend (API) and one for the frontend (UI). This results in a total of **8 microservices**.

#### **Backend Microservices (API)**

1. **Authentication Service**
    - Handles user registration, login, password reset, and third-party authentication.
2. **Campaign Management Service**
    - Manages CRUD operations for campaigns and triggers for crawling and email sending.
3. **Lead Management Service**
    - Handles CRUD operations for leads and associates them with campaigns.
4. **Settings Service**
    - Manages user-specific settings like API keys and email configurations.

#### **Frontend Microservices (UI)**

1. **Authentication Client**
    - User interface for sign-up, login, and email confirmation.
2. **Campaign Management Client**
    - UI for creating, editing, and managing campaigns.
3. **Lead Management Client**
    - UI for viewing and editing leads associated with campaigns.
4. **Settings Client**
    - UI for configuring user settings.

---

### **2. Project and Repository Structure**

Each microservice will be housed in its own Git repository to allow for independent development, deployment, and scaling.

#### **Repositories**

1. **Authentication**
    - `auth-api` (Backend)
    - `auth-ui` (Frontend)
2. **Campaign Management**
    - `campaign-api` (Backend)
    - `campaign-ui` (Frontend)
3. **Lead Management**
    - `lead-api` (Backend)
    - `lead-ui` (Frontend)
4. **Settings**
    - `settings-api` (Backend)
    - `settings-ui` (Frontend)

**Total Repositories:** 8

---

### **5. Local Development Bundling with Kubernetes**

For local development, we will use **Kubernetes orchestration** to run all microservices and the PostgreSQL database, ensuring that the development environment closely mirrors the production environment on AWS EKS.

#### **Setup Steps:**

1. **Local Kubernetes Setup:**
    
    Developers will need to install a local Kubernetes cluster. Options include:
    
    - **Minikube**
    - **Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled**
    - **MicroK8s**
    - **kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**
2. **Install Kubernetes Tools:**
    
    - **kubectl:** Command-line tool for Kubernetes.
    - **Helm:** Package manager for Kubernetes to manage complex applications.
3. **Clone Repositories:**
    
    - Developers clone the repositories for the microservices they are working on.
4. **Kubernetes Manifests or Helm Charts:**
    
    - Each microservice includes Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) or Helm charts for deployment.
    - Manifests include **Deployments**, **Services**, **Ingresses**, **ConfigMaps**, and **Secrets**.
5. **Configure Environment Variables and Secrets:**
    
    - Use **ConfigMaps** for non-sensitive configurations.
    - Use **Secrets** for sensitive data like API keys and passwords.
    - These can be templated and managed via Helm values files for different environments.
6. **Apply Configurations:**
    
    - Use `kubectl apply -f` command to apply the manifests.
    - Or, use `helm install` or `helm upgrade` commands if using Helm charts.
7. **Running Services:**
    
    - Start the local Kubernetes cluster.
    - Deploy all microservices and the PostgreSQL database to the cluster.
    - Services can be accessed via **NodePorts** or **Port Forwarding** for local access.
    - **Ingress Controllers** like **NGINX Ingress** can be installed for routing and to simulate production-like URL paths.
8. **Database Migration:**
    
    - Use Kubernetes **Jobs** or **Init Containers** to run database migrations using tools like **Flyway** or **Liquibase**.
    - Alternatively, include migration commands in the startup scripts of the backend services.
9. **Monitoring and Logging (Optional but Recommended):**
    
    - Install tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring.
    - Use **Elastic Stack (ELK)** or **Loki** for centralized logging.

#### **Advantages:**

- **Environment Parity:** Ensures that the local development environment closely mirrors production, reducing the "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Scalability Testing:** Allows developers to test scaling and orchestration behaviors locally.
- **Advanced Features:** Developers can utilize Kubernetes features like ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Ingresses.

#### **Considerations:**

- **Resource Usage:** Running Kubernetes locally consumes more resources than Docker Compose.
- **Complexity:** The initial setup is more complex and requires developers to be familiar with Kubernetes concepts.
- **Tooling:** Developers need to install and manage additional tools.

#### **Alternatives:**

- **Skaffold:** A tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications.
- **Tilt:** Another tool that simplifies microservices development on Kubernetes.

#### **Infrastructure Components:**

- **EKS Cluster:** Kubernetes cluster to orchestrate containers.
- **ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Stores Docker images.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed PostgreSQL 16 database.
- **S3 Buckets:** For storing static assets if needed.
- **Secrets Manager:** For managing secrets like API keys.

#### **Deployment Steps:**

1. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - **GitHub Actions** workflows for each repository.
    - On code push, actions will:
        - Run tests.
        - Build Docker images.
        - Push images to ECR.
        - Update Kubernetes deployments using `kubectl` or Helm charts.
2. **Kubernetes Configuration:**
    - Use **Helm charts** for managing Kubernetes manifests.
    - Define **Deployments**, **Services**, **Ingress Controllers** (e.g., NGINX) for routing.
3. **Networking:**
    - **Ingress Controller:** Manages external access to services.
    - **Service Mesh (Optional):** Use AWS App Mesh for advanced traffic management.
4. **Scaling:**
    - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:** Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU/memory usage.
    - **Cluster Autoscaler:** Scales the number of nodes in the cluster.
